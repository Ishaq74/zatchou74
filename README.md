
Hey guys, i'm very bad at managing github and repos, sorry :(

Feel free to help if you understand what i'm trying to do !

It works with const and collections, 
i still don't know which database use, for now i use netlify identity and decap cms.


TO DO LIST :

- Images from const are not working when deployed on netlify.
- Make working the CMS ( entries are empty)
- Make forms working
- Integrate schema json-ld

After tests are OK,

FUTURE STEPS :

- Change netlify identity with custom auth (email/password).
- Custom CMS
- Integrate Ecommerce (Next.js i think)
